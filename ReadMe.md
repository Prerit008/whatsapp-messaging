📱✉️ A simple HTML form to send WhatsApp messages without saving contacts.

## How It Works

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the recipient's phone number (including country code) in the "Phone Number" field.
3. Enter the message you want to send in the "Message" field.
4. Click the "Message Now" button.
5. A new browser tab/window will open, redirecting to WhatsApp Web with the pre-filled message and recipient's number. You can review the message and click the send button to send the message on WhatsApp.

Please note that WhatsApp Web needs to be logged in to the same WhatsApp account that you intend to use for sending messages.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `index.html` file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Follow the steps outlined above to send messages.
